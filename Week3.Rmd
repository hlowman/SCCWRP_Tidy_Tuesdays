## R Markdown Introduction

At first glance, this looks a lot like any other R Script, except with more text.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk by typing Mac: Command + Option + I or PC: Control + Alt + I.

```{r title_here, include = TRUE}

# Inside a code chunk works just like a script.
# Everything you type after a # symbol is a comment.

hummingbird <- 143

# If you run the above code line, it will also store the variables in your environment.

```

**NOTE TO SELF - Instruct them to delete the remainder of the document at this point and run it.**

Now, take a moment to type `include=FALSE` in the brackets next to your code chunk title. Re-knit your file and what happens?
Let's set this back to TRUE now, so it appears during out next knit.

You can use the following commands to achieve different results:

`include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing, but the chunk is still run.
`echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing.
`message = FALSE` prevents messages generated by code from appearing.
`warning = FALSE` prevents warnings generated by code from appearing.
`fig.cap = "..."` adds a caption to graphs.

As you may have guessed, there are also endless formatting options for text.

Two asterisks around text makes it **BOLD**.
A single asterisk around text makes it *ITALICIZED*.

*You can created a list using different bulleting options.
* Dashes or asterisks start the list.
  + And they can be continued using tabs on the next line.
  
(1) You can also use numbering if you like.
  + With a similar sub-heading notation.

And, of course, we can delimit parts of our code to create a table of contents.

## Standard Workflow

Today, we're going to use RMarkdown to generate some figures in a manner that will allow you to use this document among collaborators who might not code themselves.

### Dataset

First, we'll need to load in our necessary packages and our dataset. The following code chunks will be masked from appearing in the final document. 

```{r packages, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r data, include = FALSE}

chemistry <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

```


### Exploration

Before performing any analyses, it's always a good idea to take a look at your actual dataset. We **do** want to print the results of this code so that our collaborators can also see. However, if you're worried the code might throw them off, let's mask that.

```{r exploration, echo = FALSE}

# Examine the structure of the data.
str(chemistry)

```


### Figures

For all of the figures below, we will also mask the code, but add in a figure caption for each.

```{r histogram, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Histogram"}

hist(mtcars$mpg)
# Insert basic exploratory histogram here.

```

```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Scatterplot by analyte"}

# Insert geom_point plot colored by a factor here.

```

```{r facet, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Barplot by site"}

# Insert facetted geom_bar by site.

```

```{r palette, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 4. Boxplot with color palette"}

# Insert geom_boxplot using RColorBrewer color palette.

```

```{r geometries, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 5. Scatterplot + Other Geometry"}

# Insert another geom_point with an added geometry of some kind (geom_line, geom_smooth, etc.).

```

As you can see, there are a million ways you can plot your data.

Go ahead and make a new figure (choose from any of the formats above) and see if you can change the color of the plotting.

Note: To save your machine from re-running everything and slowing, you can also add `cache = TRUE` inside the {} at the top of every code chunk. Knitr will then know only to re-run that chunk if something within it changes.

The last fun thing we'll learn today is how to add a hovering table of contents. At the very top of your document, edit your header to look like the following:

`output:`
  `html_document:`
    `toc: true`
    `toc_float: true`
    `toc_depth: 3`

End of R Markdown.
