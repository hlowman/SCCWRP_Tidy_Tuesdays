## R Markdown Introduction

At first glance, this looks a lot like any other R Script, except with more text.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk by typing Mac: Command + Option + I or PC: Control + Alt + I.

```{r title_here, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}

# Inside a code chunk works just like a script.
# Everything you type after a # symbol is a comment.

hummingbird <- 143

# If you run the above code line, it will also store the variables in your environment.

```

**NOTE TO SELF - Instruct them to delete the remainder of the document at this point and run it.**

Now, take a moment to type `include=FALSE` in the brackets next to your code chunk title. Re-knit your file and what happens?
Let's set this back to TRUE now, so it appears during our next knit. There are many different commands that achieve different results, and we'll use a few more down below.

**BOLD TEXT**

*ITALICIZED TEXT*

* Create a list.
* Using dashes or asterisks.
  + Continue using tabs.
  
(1) Or use numbering.
  + Also with sub-headings.

And, of course, we can delimit parts of our code to create a table of contents.

## Standard Workflow

Today, we're going to use RMarkdown to generate some figures in a manner that will allow you to use this document among collaborators who might not code themselves.

### Dataset

First, we'll need to load in our necessary packages and our dataset. The following code chunks will be masked from appearing in the final document. 

```{r packages and data, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}

# Attach the tidyverse package.
library(tidyverse)

# Load today's dataset.
chemistry <- read_csv("tbl_chemresults.csv") # Importing data courtesy of Bowen.

```

### Exploration

Before performing any analyses, it's always a good idea to take a look at your actual dataset. 

If you're worried the code might throw off your collaborators, let's mask that.

```{r exploration, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}

# Examine the structure of the data.
str(chemistry)

# Now, let's get a glimpse of the dataset.
glimpse(chemistry)

```


### Figures

For all of the figures below, we will also mask the code using `echo = FALSE` and any messages that appear using `message = FALSE`, but add in a figure caption for each.

Reminder of figure structure:

ggplot () = builds the plot using your data

geom_* () = instructs R what kind of plot you'd like to build (point, bar, boxplot, etc.)

aes () = control the variables and aesthetics of your figure

*Facets Exercise*

```{r facet, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Metals Facetted Barplot"}

# You can create multiple different figures at once using the facet feature.

# Let's take a look at the copper, zinc, and lead data from the samples, so let's create a new dataset.

metals <- chemistry %>%
  filter(analytename == "Copper" | analytename == "Lead" | analytename == "Zinc" ) %>%
  filter(sampletype == "Result" & qualifier == "none")

# Sampletype == "Result" means we filter out all of the standards and reference materials.
# Qualifier == "none" means there were no issues during the QAQC process.
# KNOW YOUR DATA! BRING YOUR BRAIN TO THE PARTY!

# Say we're interested in looking at mean values by analytical laboratory.

metals_summary <- metals %>% # Take the original dataset and then...
  group_by(analytename, lab) %>% # group by the groupings we're interested in and then...
  summarize(mean_conc = mean(result)) %>% # calculate the mean and standard deviation of results and then...
  ungroup # remove the groupings. Don't forget it!

# Create basic facetted bar plot.

fig1 <- ggplot(data = metals_summary) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = lab, y = mean_conc), stat="identity") + # just a weird thing you need in there if the data is values instead of counts
  facet_wrap(~analytename) # facet by analytical laboratory

# Add in axes, title, and remove grey background.

fig1a <- ggplot(data = metals_summary) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = lab, y = mean_conc), stat="identity") + # just a weird thing you need in there if the data is values instead of counts
  facet_wrap(~analytename) + # facet by analytical laboratory
  labs(x = "Analytical Laboratory",
    y = "Mean Result (ug/g dry weight)",
    title = "Mean Metals Concentrations by Laboratory",
    subtitle = "Bight 2018",
    caption = "Data Source: Dr. Bowen Du, SCCWRP") + # includes labels
  theme_bw() # removes the grey background

# Remove x axis labels and instead color by laboratory.

fig1b <- ggplot(data = metals_summary) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = lab, y = mean_conc, fill = lab), stat="identity") + # just a weird thing you need in there if the data is values instead of counts
  facet_wrap(~analytename) + # facet by analytical laboratory
  labs(x = "Analytical Laboratory",
    y = "Mean Result (ug/g dry weight)",
    title = "Mean Metals Concentrations by Laboratory",
    subtitle = "Bight 2018",
    caption = "Data Source: Dr. Bowen Du, SCCWRP",
    fill = "Laboratories") + # includes labels
  theme_bw() + # removes the grey background
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) # eliminates x axis labels

fig1b

# Can also use facet_grid() to set rows and columns.

```

*Timeseries Exercise*

```{r timeseries, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 2. Total Organic Carbon Timeseries"}

# Dates can be particularly nasty to deal with, so let's practice with them using the lubridate package.

# install.packages("lubridate")

library(lubridate)

# Filter out only the total organic carbon data and create a new column with the dates properly formatted.
TOC_data <- chemistry %>%
  filter(analytename == "TOC" & sampletype == "Result" & qualifier == "none") %>%
  mutate(date_format = mdy_hm(sampledate))

# Create basic timeseries scatterplot.

fig2 <- ggplot(data = TOC_data) +  # create basic plot
  geom_point(aes(x = date_format, y = result, color = lab))

# Add in axes, title, and remove grey background.

fig2a <- ggplot(data = TOC_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date_format, y = result, color = lab)) +
  labs(x = "Date",
    y = "Result (ug/g dry weight)",
    title = "Total Organic Carbon Time Series",
    subtitle = "Bight 2018",
    caption = "Data Source: Dr. Bowen Du, SCCWRP",
    color = "Laboratories") + # includes labels
  theme_minimal() # uses another built in theme

# Edit x axis labels and edit size/shading to view overlapping points better.

fig2b <- ggplot(data = TOC_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date_format, y = result, color = lab)) +
  labs(x = "Date",
    y = "Result (ug/g dry weight)",
    title = "Total Organic Carbon Time Series",
    subtitle = "Bight 2018",
    caption = "Data Source: Dr. Bowen Du, SCCWRP",
    color = "Laboratories") + # includes labels
  theme_minimal() + # uses another built in theme
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%b-%Y") # set

fig2b

```

*Geometries Exercise*

```{r geometries, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Figure 3. Metals Boxplots with Multiple Geometries"}

# Filter out only arsenic, chromium, and nickel data.
Toxics_data <- chemistry %>%
  filter(analytename == "Arsenic" | analytename == "Chromium" | analytename == "Nickel") %>% 
  filter(sampletype == "Result" & qualifier == "none")

# Create basic boxplot with custom colors.

fig3 <- ggplot(data = Toxics_data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = analytename, y = result, color = analytename)) + # create basic boxplot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) # set colors

# Add in axes, title, and remove grey background.

fig3a <- ggplot(data = Toxics_data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = analytename, y = result, color = analytename)) + # create basic boxplot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) + # set colors
  labs(x = "Analyte",
    y = "Result (ug/g dry weight)",
    title = "Toxic Compounds in Sediment",
    subtitle = "Bight 2018",
    caption = "Data Source: Dr. Bowen Du, SCCWRP",
    color = "Analytes") + # includes labels
  theme_classic() # uses another built in theme

# Add in another geometry layer to display raw datapoints.

fig3b <- ggplot(data = Toxics_data) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = analytename, y = result, color = analytename)) + # create basic boxplot
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) + # set colors
  geom_jitter(aes(x = analytename, y = result), # add raw data points
    width = 0.2, # spread out the points
    alpha = 0.1) + # make the points relative faded/see-through
  labs(x = "Analyte",
    y = "Result (ug/g dry weight)",
    title = "Toxic Compounds in Sediment",
    subtitle = "Bight 2018",
    caption = "Data Source: Dr. Bowen Du, SCCWRP",
    color = "Analytes") + # includes labels
  theme_classic() # uses another built in theme

fig3b

# Save your most recently run plot using ggsave().

# ggsave("boxplot_example.png",
#   path = "/Users/heilil/Desktop/R_figures",
#   width = 15,
#   height = 15,
#   units = "cm")

```

As you can see, there are a million ways you can plot your data.

*Note:* To save your machine from re-running everything and slowing, you can also add `cache = TRUE` inside the {} at the top of every code chunk. Knitr will then know only to re-run that chunk if something within it changes.

The last fun thing we'll learn today is how to add a hovering table of contents. At the very top of your document, edit your header to look like the following:

`output:`
  `html_document:`
    `toc: true`
    `toc_float: true`
    `toc_depth: 3`
