## Week 1 Cheat Sheet

This is an R Markdown document that will walk through the code run during SCCWRP's Week 1 Tidy Tuesday meeting. Additional documentation and resources available at our GitHub repository at <https://github.com/hlowman/SCCWRP_Tidy_Tuesdays>.

### Part 1 : Basics

The first part of RStudio that we will be working in is called the **Console**. This is the part of the application that tells you what R is running.

Type the following into the console:

`4`

`cat <- 4`

`mouse <- 8`

`cat + mouse`

`chaos <- cat + mouse`

`cchaos` Warning: This will give you an error!

`chaos`

You'll notice as we add these variables that they appear in the **Environment** tab, in the second section of RStudio that you'll become familiar with. Whenever you want/need to clear out your existing variables, simply click on the broom button to erase all stored variables.

In this same section is the **History** tab, which will record all the code you've run. For the most part, you can ignore this tab. The **Connections** tab will show all of your connections to other databases, and the **Git** tab will allow you to version control you scripts. But we'll get to that later...

Immediately below is the third section of RStudio, where all of your **Packages** are stored.

Load a new package, called "vegan" by typing the following into your console:

`install.packages("vegan")`

You should see it pop up in the packages tab. To connect the package from your console, type the following:

`library(vegan)`

Now your package is loaded, and ready to use. The remaining tabs in this section allow you to see the **Files** that are associated with your code, the **Plots** you've created, **Help** documents when you get stuck, and view additional HTML content you might create with the **Viewer** tab. Don't worry, we'll go over each of these more in detail soon.

In Part 1, we have:

- Opened RStudio.
- Typed in the **console** and figured out what it does.
- Learned the other parts and tabs of RStudio.

You're ready to get started on your first R project!!

### Part 2: R Scripts

Create a new project.

Work in the R Script below.

```{r R Script}
plot(pressure)
```
